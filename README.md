# Delivery-Drone-Project
This is the project for the paper Reusing Delivery Drones for Urban Crowdsensing, including most code and data that we used for the paper.
We organized the important data and code, and upload here.
Most code was written in python and MATLAB languages, with pseudocode to explain the functions. 
Some pseudocode might be created during the testing process. Please ignore them.
The platform also includes some javascript code.

There is a README file in each sencondary folder that explains the content.
Please read the README file first.

If you have any question about the project, please leave a comment in the 'Issues' section above. 
I may not check Github frequently, so if it is ergent, please email me via 570486155@qq.com.


I will upload the demo and the corresponding system code soon.
